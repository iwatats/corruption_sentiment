# Corruption Sentiment

## Approach
The research will leverage [NewsCatcher API](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/) to conduct news sentiment analysis and explore consistency with face-to-face survey results on corruption through [Afrobarometer](https://www.afrobarometer.org/). The underlying hypothesis is that news sentiment analyses allow policy makers to obtain near real-time corruption perception information which, in turn, allows them to implement more timely policy interventions.
